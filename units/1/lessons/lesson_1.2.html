        <p>p5.js web editor overview</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span8">

        <p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/">p5 alpha editor</a> is a web based code editor that has the p5 library already added to the development environment.  It is an <strong>integrated development environment</strong> or <strong>IDE</strong>.  And IDE is a piece of software that allows a developer to write code and execute the code within one interface, and may have other features like debugging.
        </p>
        The code editor will by default open to the file <strong>sketch.js</strong>, which is where the main p5 program is written.  This is the<strong> text editor</strong> window.
        <p>
        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/sketchjs.png"/></br>
        <p>
        When creating a new sketch, it will populate the file with some basic starter code.  This window can be used like a typical text editor.
        <p>
        To the right of the text editor is the <strong>Preview</strong> window.  This is actually a window with the website being created in the editor embedded inside of it.  When the sketch is executed the result will appear in the preview window.
        <p>
        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/circlepreview.png"/><p>

        <p>
        Below the editor is the <strong>Console</strong> window.  The console is an interface that prints information such as errors, warning and developer logs for the developer to view as they are working on a project.
        <p>
        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/console.png"/><p>

        <p>
        Directly above the text editor are some essential interactive interfaces.
        <p>
        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/autorefresh.png"/><p>

        <p>
        The big play button with run the sketch.  The stop button will stop running the sketch.  The auto-refresh option will execute the sketch as the code is updated (I don't recommend this setting in its current version).  The title of the sketch has a pencil icon next to it which can be clicked to change the sketch name.
        <p>
        The sketch can also be run by hitting <strong>Command + Enter</strong> on the Mac keyboard and stopped with <strong>Command + Shift + Enter</strong>.  On Windows the key commands are the same except <strong>Control</strong> replaces Command.
        <p>
        The toolbar is at the top of the window.  The first menu, <strong>File</strong>, allows the user to save the current sketch, open a previously saved sketch, open an example from the p5 set of example, duplicate a saved sketch, share a sketch or download the files from a sketch.  Some of these functions will be covered in greater depth in future lessons.
        <p>
        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/filemenu.png"/><p>

        <p>
        <strong>Command + S</strong> on the Mac can also be used to save a sketch.
        <p>
        The <strong>Edit </strong>section can be used to <strong>Tidy Code</strong>, or update the code formatting.  Tidy Code is a very useful feature for new students who haven't mastered code formatting, adding indentations and curly brackets and other mistakes.  Tidy Code also has a key command, <strong>Shift + Tab</strong>.  Encourage students to use this function frequently.
        <p>

        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/editmenu.png"/><p>

        <p>
        The <strong>Sketch</strong> menu has options to run the sketch, stop the sketch and start and stop Accessibility enabled versions of the sketch.
        <p>

        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/sketchmenu.png"/><p>

        <p>
        Finally the <strong>Help & Feedback</strong> menu includes a complete list of the keyboard shortcuts and, a link to the p5 <strong>reference</strong>, which students should use as often as possible.
        <p>

        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/helpmenu.png"/><p>

        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/keyboardshortcuts.png"/><p>

        <p>
        There is also a link to give feedback to the creators of the alpha editor, either through a GitHub issue or a Google Form.  This is a great way to tell the developers about issues encountered while using the alpha editor which may be incorporated to future updates.
        <p>

        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/feedback.png"/><p>

        <p>
        Finally, in the upper right corner, there is a link to the user account setting, including a list of the user sketches.
        <p>

        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/accountmenu.png"/><p>

        <p>
        As well as a settings button that opens a menu for visual settings, such as the color theme and font size of the editor.

        <p><code>createCanvas()</code> and <code>background()</code></p>
    </div>
    <div class="span8">
        Code is just a set of instructions for the computer. In order to give instructions to p5, we'll need to use different <strong><em>functions</em></strong> and change their <strong>parameters</strong> to fit our desired output.
        <p>

        <p>
        <strong>Functions</strong> are lines of code that perform specific tasks. Two functions are automatically added to your sketch when you open the editor.
        <p>

        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/bracketed.png"/><p>

        <p>
        While setup and draw are defined by the developer in each sketch, most of the p5 functions we'll use are defined by the p5 library, and <strong>invoked</strong> in our code.
        <p>
        When a function is invoked, or called, the programmer is asking the program to run the code within the function.  The <strong>parenthesis operator</strong> is used to invoke the function.
        <p>
        Ex. <code>rect(50, 50, 100, 100)</code>;
        <p>
        The values inside of the parentheses are known as <strong>arguments</strong> or <strong>parameters</strong>.  These are used to change the outcome of a function.<p>

        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/functionname.png"/><p>

        <p>
        <strong><code>createCanvas()</code> function</strong><ul>

        <li>This function creates a p5.js canvas.</li>
        <li>The canvas is an element on the web page on which we will draw our graphics.</li>
        <li>Syntax: <code>createCanvas(width, height)</code></li>

        <p>

        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/createcanvas.png"/><p>

        <strong><code>background()</code> function</strong><ul>

        <li>This function gives our canvas a background grayscale color between 0 (black) and 255 (white)</li>
        <li>Syntax: <code>background(value)</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>

        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_1/1.2/backgroundblack.png"/><p>

        <p>
        What happens when if you were to add multiple background functions with different values? Which of background color is prioritized? Why?

    To draw on the canvas, call p5.js <em>functions</em> like <code>point()</code> and <code>line()</code>.<ul>

    <li>A point is defined by an (x, y) coordinate.</li>
    <li>A line is defined by its start and end points.</li></ul>

    <p>
    In the graphs we are used to, the y-coordinate grows upward; in p5's canvas, it grows as we move down the screen.

    <ul>

    <li><code>point(x,y)</code>-  The function name to draw a point is "point". The parameters are (x,y) which are the x and y coordinates.

    <li><code>line(x1,y1,x2,y2)</code>-  The function name to draw a line is "line."  The first x and y are the starting point and and the second are the end point.</ul>

    <p>
    <strong>Comments </strong>
    <p>
    As you can see, the lines with a '//' before them are grayed out. These are <em>comments</em>. You can use them as notes to yourself: they are ignored by the interpreter that runs the program, so they will not affect how it works.
    <p>
    If your program does not behave as you expect, it is useful to turn off lines of code one by one by 'commenting them out' (adding '//' to them). This will help you determine which one is causing the problem.<ul>

    <li>Programmers add comments to their code as notes to themselves or others who might be reading it. </li>
    <li>Commenting code is excellent practice and should be constantly encouraged.</li></ul>
