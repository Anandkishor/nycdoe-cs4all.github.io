<p>Remember the days of Microsoft Paint? When you could click a start bar, open a program that came preloaded on the computer, and just create? Those days were good. Those days were simple. Those days were internet free and possibly came with very little in the way of design sense.</p>
<p>We are better today; we have the tools needed to build our very own, p5 Microsoft Paint that looks better than ever before. And so thatâ€™s what we are going to do!</p>

<strong>Requirements</strong>:<ol>

<li>Create a program that allows you to draw with the mouse.
<li>Create at least 4 buttons that will control different aspects of the program, such as color changes.
<li>Create at least 4 key press reactions that will control different aspects of the program, such as brush type.
<li>Make sure the user understands how to use your program!</ol>

<p>
<strong>Writing Prompt: </strong>
<p>
Write a sales pitch for your program that includes instructions on how to use it and persuasive reasoning behind why you made your specific design choices.
