        <p>Draw the Same Shape Many Times</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span8">
        <p>
        Suppose we want to draw five circles on a horizontal line, 100 pixels apart from each other. We might do it this way:
         <p>
         <div class="sketch_container">
             <iframe id="canvas_iframe_1"  src="" width="600px" height="auto"></iframe>
             <div class = "editor" id="editor_1" style="height:250px;">
             </div>
         </div>
         <p><a href="http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/cs4all/sketches/SJBdyZeVZ">Now draw these ellipses 50 pixels apart from each other.</a>
         <p>
         It's very tedious to recalculate all of the x positions and update them for all five ellipses.
    </div>
</div>


<div class="row">
    <div class="span2">
        <p>Repeat Shapes With A While Loop</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span8">
        <p>In writing the code above, we followed a thought process similar to this:
        <p>
        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_3/1.1/repeat.jpg"/><p>
        Our ellipse on the left of the screen begins our row of ellipses is at 100 pixels.  We draw a new one every 100 pixels, so there's one at 200, another at 300 etc. We want a new ellipse every 100 pixels until we get to the end of the screen. We can do this with a few lines of code instead of programming each ellipse separately.
        <p>
        We already know how to write conditional statements, so we can just write a statement that says, the x location of the ellipse is 100, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">if</span> x is less than the width of the canvas, then draw an ellipse at x and add 100 to x every time you draw an ellipse.
        <p>
        We can approximate this process in code like this:
        <p>
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/cs4all/sketches/ByzqJ-lNW"><img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_3/1.1/repeatpseudo.jpg"/></a><p>
        <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/cs4all/sketches/ByzqJ-lNW">Click here to try it and see what happens. </a>
        <p>
         The following example shows the conditional statement that we just described. We declared a variable called x and initialized it to 100. If x is less than the canvas width, we drew an ellipse at the x-location of x (which is 100), but then increased x by 100.
        <p>
        You'll notice a line of code "console.log(x)". Our console helps us debug our code and will write the value in the parentheses into the console. In this case, it shows us that x did indeed increase by 100, but there is still only 1 ellipse on the screen. If the value of x is now 200, why is there no ellipse drawn at 200 as well?
        <p>
        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_3/1.1/topconsole.png"/><p>
        <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_3/1.1/console.png"/><p>

        You might remember when we began to work with conditional statements that we spoke about how a conditional runs until it evaluates to "true" and then it moves on. In this case, if x is less than width (which it is to begin with), an ellipse will be drawn at x, and x will be increased by 100. Then the code will continue until the end of the draw loop and repeat the draw loop again (which sets x to 100 all over again.)
        <p>
        We need that conditional statement to <strong>repeat</strong> itself <strong>until</strong> the conditional is no longer true.
        <p>
         There is a <em>control structure</em> called while loop that does this for us and it's one structure that we use for repetition. A control structure is a block of code that dictates the flow of the code:

         <p>
         <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_3/1.1/varx.jpg"/><p>
         There are three steps we need to take to have our while loop work correctly. <ol>

         <li>We declare and initialize a variable.  Initializing a variable is setting the initial value for that variable, or where you want it to start. In this case, we would like to it begin at 100 pixels.
         <li>We check whether it meets a condition. The condition is inside the parentheses. We want to execute the code in the brackets on condition that x is still less than the width of the canvas.
         <li>We change the value of that variable in a way that will eventually make it meet the condition. In the code below, 100 is added to x inside the brackets. Every time the code is run x will increase by 100 until it's value is larger than the width of the canvas. Then the loop will be completed and the program will move on in the code.</ol>
         <p>
             <img src="../../../images/lessons/unit_3/1.1/varxred.jpg"/><p>
         <a href="http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/cs4all/sketches/HJUxl-eN-">When we run this code we will see the same result that we saw when we programmed each individual ellipse 100 pixels apart. </a>
         <p>
         <div class="sketch_container">
             <iframe id="canvas_iframe_2"  src="" width="600px" height="auto"></iframe>
             <div class = "editor" id="editor_2" style="height:250px;">
             </div>
         </div>
         <p>
         Our code is cleaner now, but the benefit of using a while loop is how easily we can change it. Say I wanted a row of ellipses with the same spacing, but I wanted the row to start at the beginning of the canvas.
         <p>
         I will "initialize" variable x to 20 because the ellipse is 40 pixels wide and if I set x to 0, half of my ellipse would be off the canvas.
         <p>
         <div class="sketch_container">
             <iframe id="canvas_iframe_3"  src="" width="600px" height="auto"></iframe>
             <div class = "editor" id="editor_3" style="height:250px;">
             </div>
         </div>
         <p>
         Notice how the program added an extra circle and we didn’t even have to ask. That happens because the program will continue to draw circles as long as x is less than the width of the canvas.
         <p>
         The spacing between the shapes is based on the number by which we increment the variable. In the previous examples, we added 100 to x every time the loop ran. What happens if we only increment the variable by 40 (the width of the ellipse)?
         <div class="sketch_container">
             <iframe id="canvas_iframe_4"  src="" width="600px" height="auto"></iframe>
             <div class = "editor" id="editor_4" style="height:250px;">

        <p>Exercise #2: Use a while loop with multiple shapes</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span8">
        <p>Now that we know how to draw a shape repeatedly by incrementing a variable, we can think about adding other shapes to our loop that also use our x variable. Try creating a design that you can repeat inside a while loop.
        <p>The following example uses multiple ellipses with the same location but with different sizes.
            <div class="sketch_container">
                <iframe id="canvas_iframe_6"  src="" width="600px" height="auto"></iframe>
                <div class = "editor" id="editor_6" style="height:250px;">
                </div>
            </div>
        <p>This example requires thinking about how to draw more shapes and place them in relation to the x variable which we have done before in a previous lesson.
